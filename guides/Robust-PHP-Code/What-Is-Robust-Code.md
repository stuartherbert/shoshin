What Is Robust Code?
====================

> Software is said to be robust when it performs well under unexpected conditions which stress the designer's assumptions, as well as under normal conditions. (Eric S. Raymond, _The Art Of UNIX Programming_)[http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html#id2878145]

Now think about those times when you've found a piece of software that works well all the time.  Think about how that makes you feel.

As a programmer, I strive to make software as robust as is practically possible.  To h
