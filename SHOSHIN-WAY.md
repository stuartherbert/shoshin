The Shoshin Way

Our Core Idea

At the heart of every Shoshin Guide is a core idea: that we must always be looking to learn, every minute of every day, from everyone that we meet.

* It is learning that propels our lives, that gives us the skills we need to survive, to succeed, to appreciate, and to propser.
* When we stop learning, the world around us doesn't stop changing.  We get left behind, and our capability to contribute back to others diminishes.
* It is the openness of constant learning that allows us to face change without fear, and to help create the future rather than simply relive the past.
* When we believe that we know what we need to know, we stop seeing the world in different ways. We become fixed in our approach, and come to defend fixed positions that are increasingly invalid. New opportunities start to pass us by.
* It is our willingness to show what we do that allows others to take their own steps through the doors that we have opened for them.

This is the [shoshin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin), or "__beginner's mind__", that we express through our Shoshin Guides.


The Shoshin Way
---------------

This is our guide whenever we create works for the inquiring mind.

We are:

1. __STUDENTS NOT MASTERS:__ We see ourselves as students of our art or field first and foremost, no matter what our professional achievements to date.
1. __TEACHERS NOT LECTURERS:__ We show what we do. We do not tell others what they should do.
1. __TRUSTEES NOT OWNERS:__  It is our responsibility to pass what we have learned on to the next generation so that they can surpass us.

We value:

1. __LIFELONG LEARNING:__ We believe in that there is always more to be known on a subject than we know today, and that everyone of all ages can continue to learn and grow.
1. __SHARE TO LEARN:__ We share our experiences so that we in turn can learn from the experiences of, and feedback from, others.
1. __LIVED EXPERIENCE:__ We value the experiences that we have lived, above the knowledge that we have read but not applied.
1. __SCRUTINY:__ We value that which stands up to close scrutiny and the kind of testing that comes from doing.
1. __MINDFULNESS:__ We value that which is done out of deliberate choice.
1. __PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES:__ We understand that many other approaches are just as valid as the ones we choose.
1. __CORRECTNESS:__ We value the accuracy of what we say, and what we teach to others.
